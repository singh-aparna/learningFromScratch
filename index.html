        <ul>
            <li>example github user's api</li>
            <li>What it does:</li>

            <li>How API Enables Communication:</li>
            <li>The food app (client) sends a request to Google Maps API (server).</li>
            <li>Google Maps API processes the request and returns a response with location data.</li>
            <li>The food app uses this response to show real-time restaurant locations.</li>
