                <h2>How does Nodejs works? (asked in interview)</h2>
                <p>Node.js works by using the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code,
                    along with an event-driven,
                    non-blocking I/O model
                    to handle multiple requests efficiently.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>What is event driven & non blocking I/O model?</h2>
                <p>The event-driven, non-blocking I/O model in Node.js allows it to handle multiple requests
                    asynchronously
                    using callbacks,
                    Promises, or async/await,
                    without waiting for one task to complete before starting another.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?</h2>
                <p>Node.js handles asynchronous operations using an event loop,
                    callbacks, Promises,
                    and async/await,
                    enabling non-blocking execution for efficient performance. </p>

                <h2>What is Express.js? (asked in interview)</h2>
                <p>Express.js is a Node.js framework for building api and web servers.<br />
                    example - <br />
                    â€¢ creating basic server // const express = require('express'), app = express(); app.get('/', (req,
                    res) => res.send('Hello World')); app.listen(3000);<br />
                    â€¢ serving JSON // app.get('/api', (req, res) => res.json({ message: 'API response' }));<br />
                    â€¢ Route with parameters // app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => res.send(`User ID:
                    ${req.params.id}`)); </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>How does jwt token works? (asked in interview)</h2>
                <p>Summary in Simple Terms<br />
                    The server creates a token, signs it with a secret key, and gives it to the client.<br />
                    The client sends the token back with each request.<br />
                    The server verifies the token to ensure itâ€™s valid and processes the request.<br />
                    Itâ€™s like an ID card: the client shows it to prove who they are, and the server checks its
                    authenticity!</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>useEffect Dependency (asked in interview)</h2>
                <p>No dependency (useEffect(callback)) â†’ Runs after every render.<br />
                    Empty array (useEffect(callback, [])) â†’ Runs only once after the initial render, similar to
                    componentDidMount in class components.<br />
                    With dependencies (useEffect(callback, [dep1, dep2])) â†’ Runs after the initial render and whenever
                    any dependency changes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>What next() does in a middleware? (asked in interview)</h2>
                <p>In middleware, next is a function that passes control to the next middleware in the stack; if not
                    called, the request will hang.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>How does JWT authentication work in Node.js?</h2>
                <p>JWT authentication in Node.js works by generating a token with user data,
                    signing it with a secret, and then using that token to authenticate subsequent requests without
                    storing session data. ðŸš€

            <li>
                <h2>What is CORS, and how do you enable it in Node.js?</h2>
                <p>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows or restricts web applications from making requests to
                    domains outside their own,
                    and it can be enabled in Node.js using the cors middleware. ðŸš€</p>
            </li>


            <li>
                <h2>useMemo hook (asked in interview)</h2>
                <p>useMemo is a React hook that memoizes the result of a function,
                    preventing unnecessary recalculations and improving performance by only recomputing when
                    dependencies change. ðŸš€</p>
            </li>


            <li>
                <h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
                <p>
                    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to enhance
                    development and code quality.<br />
                    - Key Points:<br />
                    <b>Static Typing</b>: In TypeScript, you can declare the data types of variables and function
                    parameters
                    (string, number, etc.).<br />
                    <b>Type Safety</b>: It helps catch errors at compile time instead of runtime, making your code more
                    reliable.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in Node.js?</h2>
                <p>Synchronous code in Node.js executes tasks sequentially, blocking the next task until the current one
                    finishes,
                    while asynchronous code allows tasks to execute non-blocking and in parallel, improving performance.
                </p>
            </li>


            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of middleware in Express.js.</h2>
                <p>Middleware is software that acts as a bridge,
                    processing requests and responses between the client and server or between different application
                    layers.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>How do you handle errors in Node.js?</h2>
                <p>Errors in Node.js are handled using try...catch (for synchronous code),
                    .catch() (for Promises), and error-first callbacks or process.on('uncaughtException') for global
                    errors. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>What is the difference between CommonJS and ES modules?</h2>
                <p>CommonJS (require/module.exports) is used in Node.js for synchronous module loading,
                    while ES Modules (import/export) support asynchronous loading and are the modern JavaScript
                    standard.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Event Loop</h2>
                <p>The Event Loop in Node.js is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations
                    by continuously checking and executing
                    pending tasks in the callback queue. ðŸš€</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Does JS event loop and node.js event loop both are same?</h2>
                <p>The Node.js event loop has extra phases to manage asynchronous I/O, timers, and worker threads, while
                    the browser event loop primarily deals with UI rendering, event listeners, and network requests.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Difference b/w parameters & arguments.</h2>
                <p>- Parameters exist in function definitions.<br />
                    - Arguments are the real values passed when invoking a function.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>useSelector?</h2>
                <p>
                    useSelector is a React-Redux hook that selects and retrieves state from the Redux store in a
                    functional component.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>body-parser?</h2>
                <p>body-parser is a middleware in Express
                    that parses incoming request bodies in various formats (such as JSON, URL-encoded) and makes the
                    data accessible in req.body.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>cookie-parser?</h2>
                <p>cookie-parser is a middleware in Express that parses cookies
                    attached to the incoming requests and populates req.cookies with the cookies as key-value pairs.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>payload?</h2>
                <p>A payload is the data or information sent in a request or response, often in the body of HTTP
                    requests or within a token like a JWT.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Axios vs fetch</h2>
                <p>Axios and Fetch are HTTP clients used for making requests to servers.<br />
                    - Fetch is the native browser API, built in JS function => used to make http request => adhering to
                    modern promise-based standards.<br />
                    - Axios is a widely-used third-party library renowned for its concise syntax and extensive feature
                    set.<br />

                    - Axios is generally better due to its simplicity,
                    built-in features like automatic JSON parsing, request/response interceptors(Middleware), and
                    broader browser compatibility.
                    compared to Fetch.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Lexical scope</h2>
                <p>Lexical scoping is a programming language feature where the scope of a variable is determined by its
                    position in the source code, and it is defined by the stucture of the code, not by the runtime flow
                    of the program.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Closure?</h2>
                <p>A closure is a function that remembers and accesses variables from its outer scope, even after the
                    outer function has finished executing.<br />
                    this means the function has access to variables in its lexical environment.
                </p>
